The main objective of Myannovation is to become a tech bridge for farmers. 

Due to the increasing fuel cost, farmers have started using solar water pumps as an alternative. However many solar systems used to irrigate the crops are very manual and lack remote monitoring and control capability. 

To address this uncontrolled solar water pump system issue, Myannovation started the development of a Smart Pump Controller device (SMPC1901) as the very first product model.
This controller device will be compatible with all types of solar systems. It will be operable via a smartphone, providing farmers with efficient and convenient control over their solar-powered water pumps.
